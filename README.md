# Boston-Transit-Tracker
A tracker for upcoming public transit options in a local area.

## Project Goals:
Gives easy to read information for all public transportation between two points using [MTBA's API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api).

Utilizes an arduino board to power lights to give real-time alerts for upcoming trains or buses similar to a stop sign seen throughout the city, with the notable difference being the use of a LED matrix over an LCD or e-ink display.
